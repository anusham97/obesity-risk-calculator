      "AI Explanation: Your obesity risk score is 42.0, which falls into the \"Moderate\" category. This means there are several factors influencing your risk of obesity, and understanding these can help you make positive changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Factors That Increase Your Risk:**\n",
      "1. **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: Your BMI is contributing significantly to your risk. This measures your weight in relation to your height. Higher BMI levels can increase your chances of health issues.\n",
      "2. **Waist Circumference**: Abdominal fat is considered a major health risk, and your waist measurement points to a higher risk status.\n",
      "3. **A1C Levels**: This measures your blood sugar control over time. Higher levels indicate a risk of diabetes, affecting your overall health.\n",
      "4. **Cholesterol Levels**: Your total cholesterol is another factor; while it’s not the highest contributor, it's important to keep it in check.\n",
      "5. **Hypertension**: Having high blood pressure adds to your risk profile. It’s crucial to monitor this with regular check-ups.\n",

    "- Most NHANES adults scored near the middle of the risk range using sample-based normalization, but nearly all landed in the high-risk group when stricter clinical min/max were used.\n",

    "- Smoking and recent weight gain affected the risk score less than expected, highlighting the model's emphasis on core metabolic markers.\n",
